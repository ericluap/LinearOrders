# LinearOrders

Formalization of results regarding linear orders in Lean.

## Main Theorems Formalized

### Theorem (Finite Left Cancellation)

If $X$ and $Y$ are linear orders, $n \in \mathbb{N}$, and $nX \cong nY$, then $X \cong Y$.

### Theorem (Lindenbaum)

If $X$ and $Y$ are linear orders such that $X$ embeds in an initial segment of $Y$ and $Y$ embeds in a final segment of $X$, then $X \cong Y$.
